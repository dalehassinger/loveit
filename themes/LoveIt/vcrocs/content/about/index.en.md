**My personal focus is helping the vCommunity with VCF, VCF Automation, VCF Operations and PowerCLI <small>(PowerShell)</small>.**  

- There’s no better feeling at the end of the day than when someone reaches out to thank you for sharing a blog you took the time to create. Knowing that your work has helped others is incredibly rewarding.

**When I was a VMware customer:**  
- I created an IaC (Infrastructure as Code) environment.  
- I used VCF Automation and Operations <small>(VMware vRealize Automation, vRealize Operations and SaltStack Config)</small>  
- I used VCF Automation to complete server builds, software installs, schedule VM snapshots, Microsoft 365 automation, Citrix management, automate data center flips, server decommissions, and many other Day 2 processes…  
- For observability, I used  VCF Operations for the “Single Pane of Glass” experience.  
- I also used VCF Operations for Logs  
- I used LCM (Life Cycle Manager) for installing the VCF Automation and Operations Products.  
- The code I create to complete automation is mostly done with PowerShell, because to automate VMware products, VMware has a PowerShell module named PowerCLI. There hasn't been anything that I wanted to automate that I haven't been able to do with PowerShell.

* I have learned a lot from the vCommunity, Powershell and PowerCLI web sites. I want to use this Blog Site as a way for me to give back. If one person finds anything I post helpful, I will consider my efforts successful.  

* The code that I have shared on this Blog Site is code that I use with VCF Automation Templates/Catalog Items and everyday VMware Admin functions. Everyday I learn something new. If I think it should be shared I will write a blog about it. Check back often to see what I am doing next.
