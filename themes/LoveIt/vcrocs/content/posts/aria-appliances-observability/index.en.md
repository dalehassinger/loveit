###### Aria Appliance Observability

In my previous blog, I discussed **VMware vCenter** appliance observability. [Click here to read the blog](https://www.vcrocs.info/vcenter-observability/). Building on those ideas, I now want to demonstrate how to monitor **VMware Aria** Appliances. Monitoring and observing VMware Aria Appliance VMs is crucial in a VMware environment where many such appliances are present.

For VMware Aria Appliances, I created a Custom Group within VMware Aria Operations. These appliances have a property named "Summary|Configuration|Product Name". By using a filter that checks if the Product Name contains "Aria", "vRealize", or "Log Insight", I was able to group all VMware Aria Appliance VMs together.

This filter is applicable to the following Aria Appliances:  
- Aria Operations  
- Aria Operations for Logs  
- Aria Automation
- Aria Suite LifeCycle
- Aria Cloud Proxies
- Aria Operations for Networks
- Aria Management Pack Builder
- vCenter Orchestrator

After creating the Custom Group to select only VMware Aria Appliance VMs, I proceeded to build a comprehensive VMware Aria Appliance Monitoring Dashboard. At the top, I included some donut charts (my favorite) to display key metrics such as VMware Aria Appliances Health, Workload, Snapshots, and Uptime in days.

I have a strong preference against VMs running on snapshots for extended periods, which is why I included a chart for Snapshots. Uptime is also a crucial metric, as it provides insight into a VMs maintenance status. When I see a VM running for hundreds of days, my first thought is that it hasn't been patched or upgraded in a while. To ensure the best reliability and access to the latest features, it's important to keep Aria Appliances patched and upgraded regularly.

###### Steps to Create the Dashboard  

1. Create the (5) Views  
   * Show all Aria Appliance VMs with details  
   * Show VM Health  
   * Show VM Workload  
   * Show Snapshot Status  
   * Show Uptime (Days)
2. Create the Dashboard

To simplify getting started, all the Views and the Dashboard are available in my GitHub repository for download. [Click Here to Download the files.](https://github.com/dalehassinger/unlocking-the-potential/tree/main/VMware-Aria-Operations/Dashboards/Aria-Appliances-Observability)

###### Product Version used for Blog Post:
* Aria Operations: 8.17.1

###### Lessons Learned:
* I can use the Virtual Machine property named "Summary|Configuration|Product Name" to group all VMware Aria Appliances together. The filter within the Custom Group is what enables this Dashboard to work.
