**How to Allocate CPU and Memory for VMs Using T-Shirt Sizes or Custom Values**

###### VMware Aria Automation | VM | CPU and Memory  

Recently, I was asked how to create new VMs using T-Shirt sizes and also have the flexibility to specify custom CPU and Memory values. Typically, in the YAML code of a Aria Automation Design Template, you use either the properties `cpuCount` and `totalMemoryMB` or the `flavor` property. You **cannot** use both within the same template for the same VM.

After considering the options, I decided to use the `cpuCount` and `totalMemoryMB` properties to specify VM CPU and memory, adding logic to the YAML code to determine values based on an input named Flavor.

**Flavor Options:**
* Small: 1 CPU, 2 GB memory
* Medium: 2 CPUs, 4 GB memory
* Large: 4 CPUs, 8 GB memory
* Other: Use CPU and Memory values specified in custom inputs `CPU` and `Memory`. See the Full Design Template YAML code below.

---

These two lines of YAML code demonstrate how to specify the `cpuCount` and `totalMemoryMB` properties. This is the key to enabling both T-Shirt sizes and custom values:

cpuCount: "${(input.Flavor == 'small') ? 1 : (input.Flavor == 'medium') ? 2 : (input.Flavor == 'large') ? 4 : (input.Flavor == 'other') ? input.CPU : 1}"
totalMemoryMB: "${(input.Flavor == 'small') ? 2048 : (input.Flavor == 'medium') ? 4096 : (input.Flavor == 'large') ? 8192 : (input.Flavor == 'other') ? input.Memory * 1024 : 1024}"

**Flavors:**

In my lab, I already had some Flavor Mappings defined. To allow for larger sizes, I had to create a new Flavor Mapping for the maximum sizes I wanted to support. I couldn't specify CPU or memory sizes higher than the largest existing Flavor Mapping.

**Warning I received while testing:**

**Summary:**

I hope this helps anyone looking to standardize new VM builds using T-Shirt sizes while also providing the flexibility to specify custom CPU and Memory values.
