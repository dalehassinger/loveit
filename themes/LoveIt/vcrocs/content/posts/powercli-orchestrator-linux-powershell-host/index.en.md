**How to use a Rocky Linux PowerShell Host with VCF Automation Orchestrator. Linux ❤️ PowerShell!**

<!--more-->

---

>Streamline VMware Automation with VCF Automation, a Rocky Linux PowerShell host, custom workflows, and the simplicity of PowerCLI.

---
###### I like using PowerShell on Linux in my Lab:  

In most cases, a PowerShell Host for VCF Automation Orchestrator is set up on a Windows Server, which works seamlessly. Having spent much of my career working with Microsoft Windows Server, I’m well-versed in its capabilities. However, in my lab, where resource efficiency is a priority, I prefer to run Linux VMs whenever possible. I keep these Linux VMs lean and mean for maximum performance.  

I set out to explore how a Rocky Linux VM could function as a PowerShell Host. By default, VCF Automation Orchestrator includes a workflow called “Run SSH Command”, designed to execute SSH commands on a server. I began testing with this built-in workflow and customized it to better align with my requirements.  

To keep the setup simple, I wanted to create a single workflow where I could specify the PS script path and name. The Linux VM details—such as hostname, username, password, and port—would remain static.  

>For 2025, I’ve been invited to be a **VMware Community {code} Coach**! This year, my blogs will feature even more code examples to help others get started with automation, VMware solutions, and much more...

###### Running PowerShell from the CLI and Executing a Script:

<small><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Click arrow to expand the PowerShell code:</span></small>  
```Bash
pwsh -file /home/administrator/Home-Lab-PS.ps1

# If you want to use Script Parameters
pwsh -file /home/administrator/Home-Lab-PS.ps1 -vmName "VM-01" -PowerState "On"

```

###### Workflow Design:

* [Click to download the workflow](https://github.com/dalehassinger/unlocking-the-potential/blob/main/VMware-Aria-Automation/Workflows/SSH-Run-PowerShell-Script.package)
* Import the Package into Orchestrator

---

**Java Script used in the Workflow to SSH to the Rocky Linux PowerShell Host and run a PS Script:**  

<small><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Click arrow to expand the JavaScript code:</span></small>  
```JavaScript
var session = null;
try {
	if (port) {
		session = new SSHSession(hostNameOrIP, username, port);
	} else {
		System.log("A port value is not provided! Using default port 22");
		session = new SSHSession(hostNameOrIP, username);
	}

	if (passwordAuthentication){
		System.log("Connecting with password");
	} else {
		if (path == null || path == ""){
			System.log("using default");
			path = defaultKeyPairPath;
		}
		System.log("Connecting with key pair (" + path + ")");
		password = passphrase;
	}

	session.connectWithPasswordOrIdentity(passwordAuthentication, password, path);
	System.log("Connected!");

	System.log("Executing '" + cmd + "' using encoding '" + (encoding ? encoding : "Default System Encoding") + "'");
	session.setEncoding(encoding);
	session.executeCommand(cmd, true);

	output = session.getOutput();

	System.log("Output: '" + output + "'");

} catch (e) {
	throw "Unable to execute command: " + e;
} finally {
	if (session) {
		session.disconnect();
	}
}

```

###### Code Examples:  

* YAML file to store values to be used with scripts

<small><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Click arrow to expand the YAML code:</span></small>
```YAML
# vCenter Connection Values
vCenter:
  server: vcsa8x.vcrocs.local
  username: administrator@vcrocs.local
  password: VMware1!
  ignoreCertErrors: true
```

**Sample PowerShell Script:**  
* Sample script that I used to show that Rocky Linux can be used as a PowerShell Host

<small><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Click arrow to expand the PowerShell code:</span></small>  
```PowerShell
# Ensure required modules are installed before proceeding
$requiredModules = @("powershell-yaml", "VMware.PowerCLI")
foreach ($module in $requiredModules) {
    if (-not (Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name $module)) {
        Write-Host "$module is not installed. Install it using 'Install-Module $module'." -ForegroundColor Red
        exit
    }
}

# Read YAML configuration
$cfgFile = "Home-Lab-Config.yaml"
$cfg = Get-Content -Path $cfgFile -Raw | ConvertFrom-Yaml

Write-Host "Executing Script"

# Connect to vCenter
Write-Host "Connecting to vCenter..."

try {
    $credential = New-Object PSCredential ($cfg.vCenter.username, (ConvertTo-SecureString $cfg.vCenter.password -AsPlainText -Force))
    $vCenter = Connect-VIServer -Server $cfg.vCenter.server -Credential $credential -Force

    Write-Host "Running commands..."

    $vmNames = Get-VM | Select-Object Name, PowerState | Sort-Object Name

    $vmNames.Name

    Disconnect-VIServer -Server * -Confirm:$false

    Write-Host "Disconnecting from vCenter..."

    return "Script Completed"
}
catch {
    Write-Host "An error occurred: $_"
    return "Error: $_"
}

```

* VCF Automation Catalog with an Option to run the Orchestrator Workflow that was created to run the script on Rocky Linux  

{{< image src="linux0ps-host-02.png" caption="Click to see Larger Image of Screen Shot">}}  

---

* Orchestrator Workflow as a Catalog Item  
* This is a simple example to give you ideas. The script that will run could bascially Automate anything  
* Script Parameters become fields on a custom form
* If you can write a script for the process, you can Automate it with Orchestrator

###### Install PowerShell on Rocky Linux:

<small><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Click arrow to expand the PowerShell code:</span></small>  
```Bash

# Install PowerShell on Rocky Linux
sudo dnf install -y powershell

# Ensure OpenSSH is installed and running
sudo dnf install -y openssh-server
sudo systemctl enable --now sshd

# Create a PowerShell subsystem entry in the SSH daemon config
echo "Subsystem powershell /usr/bin/pwsh -sshs -NoProfile" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Restart the SSH service
sudo systemctl restart sshd

```

###### Lessons Learned:

* If you like to use Linux for Servers, this is a good use case for running PowerShell scripts  
* If you have existing PowerShell scripts that run on a Windows Server, most scripts should run on Linux with little to no modifications  
* I enjoy bringing consistency to my scripts by leveraging a YAML file, similar to the approach used in automation platforms I work with  
* All the scripts in this blog were created and tested on a Mac using PowerShell  
* Don’t dismiss PowerShell just because it was created by Microsoft. Embrace it to enhance your automation journey!
