**How to use Input Arrays with ABX Actions.**

<!--more-->

---

>Don’t automate for the sake of automation—automate to simplify, accelerate, and improve.

---

<small>**Note: VCF Automation 8.18.1 was used to create this Blog**</small>  

I recently received a question about leveraging an Array Input from a VCF Automation Template and processing the array data within an ABX Action. Below, you'll find example code and screenshots demonstrating the approach. If you're working with array inputs in your automation workflows, this guide should be helpful!

**Screenshots demonstrating the use of VCF Automation Input Arrays:**

* <small>**Example manual Deployment that has an Array Input**</small>

**Screen Shot of the YAML Code for Input Array:**


* <small>**Define the input type as array**</small>
* <small>**Use the array input in the "Cloud.vSphere.Machine" - "properties:" section**</small>
* <small>**All properties values will get passed in the ABX Action**</small>

**Screen Shot of the Inputs:**

* <small>**If you haven't worked with YAML array inputs before, use the Inputs screens in VCF Automation to assist in formatting the YAML correctly. This will ensure the data is structured properly before being passed to the ABX Action.**</small>

**Screen Shot of the Array Creation with Inputs:**

* <small>**Here's an example of PowerShell code that takes a YAML array string passed to an ABX Action, cleans it up, and converts it into a PowerShell array**</small>
* <small>**This is the most critical step in this blog post. Take the time to understand how the YAML string is transformed into a PowerShell array, as this enables you to leverage the array values for any automation tasks needed in your server build process.**</small>
* <small>**The PowerShell code processes the YAML string by replacing unnecessary characters, ensuring proper formatting, and then splitting the string on commas to create a PowerShell array. This transformation allows the data to be easily iterated and used within the ABX Action.**</small>

**Screen Shot of the YAML Array Values:**

* <small>**This example demonstrates how the YAML array format is passed to the ABX Action as a string. Understanding this format is essential for parsing and utilizing the array data effectively within your automation logic.**</small>

###### VCF Automation Design Template  

**Example ABX Action Code:**  

* <small>**Code from the screen shots above.**</small>
* <small>**My example code simply outputs the values to demonstrate how to create the array and validate that the code works. Once you have this structure in place, you can extend the `foreach` section to automate any tasks you need.**</small>

<small><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Click arrow to expand the ABX Action PowerShell code:</span></small>  
```PowerShell

function handler($context, $inputs) {

    if(!$inputs.customProperties.vmAdminUsers){
        $vmAdminUsers = "NA"
    }else{
        $vmAdminUsers = $inputs.customProperties.vmAdminUsers
    }
    
    Write-Host "STR vmAdminUsers:" $vmAdminUsers
    
    # Input string
    #$vmAdminUsers = '[\"dale.hassinger\",\"brock\",\"chris\"]'
    
    
    # Convert the string into an array
    $Array = $vmAdminUsers -replace '[\[\\\"\]]', '' -split ','
    
    # Output the array
    # Iterate through each item in the array and display its value
    foreach ($Item in $Array) {
        Write-Host "Username: $Item"
    }

    Write-Host "Array:" $Array
    Write-Host "Array Count:"$Array.Count

  return $inputs
}

```

###### Lessons learned:

* Using Array Inputs are a great way to use multiple values for processes needed to build new VMs.  
* After you take the YAML array string and turn it into a PowerShell array, you can use the values to automate anything you can script.
