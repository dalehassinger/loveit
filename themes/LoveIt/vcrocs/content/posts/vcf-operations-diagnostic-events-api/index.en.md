[Brock Peterson](https://www.brockpeterson.com) released a blog titled ["Extracting Diagnostics Events from Aria Operations"](https://www.brockpeterson.com/post/extracting-diagnostics-events-from-aria-operations) on December 16, 2024. Prior to reading this [blog](https://www.brockpeterson.com/post/extracting-diagnostics-events-from-aria-operations), I was unaware that the diagnostic data added to VCF Operations could be extracted using the VCF Operations API. This is an excellent read that you should check out before working with the example PowerShell script shared within this blog post.  

I've received several inquiries from people asking how to extract diagnostic data from VCF Operations since the VMware Skyline service was officially retired (EOL). In the past, VMware Technical Adoption Managers (TAMs) relied on VMware Skyline data to help customers ensure their environments remained up to date with the latest patches. This script could potentially serve as an alternative for extracting diagnostic data from VCF Operations and sharing it with a TAM.  

If you don't have a VMware TAM but still want to share this data with your internal VMware team, this script will work perfectly for that use case as well. The Excel file generated by this script can also be used to provide your security team with insights into the diagnostic data available within VCF Operations.  

For automating this script to run on a weekly or daily basis, I recommend using VCF Orchestrator, which is part of VCF Automation.  

I also have the example code saved in my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dalehassinger/unlocking-the-potential/tree/main/VMware-Aria-Operations/API-Examples/Extract-Diagnostics-Events)

##### Code Details:

- Demonstrates how to connect to the VCF Operations API  
- Generates a token for making API requests  
- Creates an Excel spreadsheet to save the events using the `importExcel` PowerShell module  
- Includes optional code to send the newly created Excel file as an email attachment
