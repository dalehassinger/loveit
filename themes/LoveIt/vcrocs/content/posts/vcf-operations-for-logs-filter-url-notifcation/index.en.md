**How to Create a URL for Filtering Log Results and Share It with Others.**

<!--more-->

---

>I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work. – Thomas Edison

---

<small>**Note: VCF Operations for Logs 8.18.0 was used to create this Blog**</small>

In my previous blog, I focused on how to send log events to the **VCF Operations for Logs API**. [Click here to read...](https://www.vcrocs.info/vcf-operations-for-logs-syslog-api/) In this blog, I’ll demonstrate how to **generate a URL** that connects to VCF Operations for Logs and automatically applies a **filter** based on the log events you’ve just sent.

When running an automation script, as shown in the example below, I want the results to be saved in **VCF Operations for Logs**. To make it easier for the person running the script to view the logged events, I’ve incorporated the generation of the VCF Operations for Logs URL directly into the automation script. When reviewing the VCF Operations for Logs URL format, I found that it wasn’t very human-readable.

To simplify the generation of the VCF Operations for Logs URL that includes a filter, I created a function that accepts parameters for the required filter items. In my example, I’m embedding the generated URL in an email, making it easy to click and have VCF Operations for Logs open  directly to your filtered data. I love Automation!

###### Example Code:  

(3) Functions:  
* Function to Send event logs to VCF Operations for Logs API  
* Function to generate the VCF Operations for Logs URL  
* Function to send the email with the link in the email body

Automation Script Example:  
* Shows how to use the (3) Functions in the example code above   

<small><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Click arrow to expand the code:</span></small>  
```PowerShell

# Load the Create Events, Create URL and Send Email functions script, which will be used for logging events via Aria Operations for Logs API.
. /Path-to-Script/aria-operations-for-logs-syslog-api.ps1

# Define the VM name and the script process description
$vmName = "vCROCS-W2K22-06"

###### Lessons Learned:

* VCF Operations for Logs is an excellent syslog solution, offering intuitive and user-friendly filtering tools.
* Always format events in a way that simplifies the creation of filters.
* Generating the VCF Operations Log URL link makes filtering and viewing events very easy.
