**About the VMware vExpert Program:**

The VMware vExpert Program is a global evangelism and advocacy initiative. It provides recognition and marketing support to individuals who actively share their knowledge and expertise with the community. Benefits include article promotion, visibility at global events, access to beta programs, and insight into VMware’s roadmap.

The program awards are individual-based and valid for one year. Both partner and customer employees are eligible. Applications are evaluated based on contributions from the past year, or both past and current activities in the case of second-half applications.

vExpert recognition is based on community involvement that goes beyond day-to-day responsibilities. Examples of accepted contributions include blogging, authoring books or articles, public speaking, participating in forums, leading VMUGs, producing videos, and more.
