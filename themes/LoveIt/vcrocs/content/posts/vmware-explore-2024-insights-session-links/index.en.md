###### VMware Explore 2024

As a customer attending VMware Explore, I always thought about presenting and sharing the knowledge I've gained from working with VMware products with the vCommunity. This year, that thought became a reality. I presented one general session, three {code} theater sessions, and presented or co-presented seven {code} lab sessions. Presenting all day at a technology conference leaves you exhausted by the end of the day!  

One of my sessions, 'Maximizing VMware Workstation/Fusion for Business, Education, and Home Labs' (CODE1162LV), was highlighted in an article by [Virtualization and Cloud Review](https://bit.ly/3Z4ZV37), and it received positive feedback."  

>"One session that I got a lot out of was a VMware Code session entitled "Maximizing VMware Workstation/Fusion for Business, Education, and Home Labs" [CODE1162LV]. The presenter, Dale Hassinger, VCF Specialist Architect, Broadcom, showed how to work with VMware Workstation using APIs, something that I have never done before but plan on doing so after attending his session." - [Virtualization and Cloud Review](https://bit.ly/3Z4ZV37)  

Being the only session mentioned by name in the [Virtualization and Cloud Review](https://bit.ly/3Z4ZV37) article was a proud moment for me as a presenter. We put a lot of time and effort into our presentations, so receiving recognition from a writer for [Virtualization and Cloud Review](https://bit.ly/3Z4ZV37) feels really good.  

I enjoy presenting in the {code} Theatre because those sessions were where I learned a lot as a customer, and I want to give back to the {code} community. I also enjoy working with [Franky Barragan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-barragan/), the VMware {code} Community Manager. When you talk with Franky, you can hear the passion he has for the {code} community in every conversation. Franky also did an awesome job organizing the Hackathon!  

This year, I had the opportunity to co-present with a customer, [Don Horrox](https://www.vchamp.net/). Don is a systems engineer, and the team he works with has implemented some impressive use cases with the VCF Automation and Operations products. Our session received excellent survey reviews. Don and his teammate, [Amos Clerizier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amos-clerizier/), were also part of my Hackathon team. They had a great time and contributed a lot of fantastic ideas. Amos wrote a powerful script that takes RVTools data, de-identifies it, sends it to ChatGPT for prompts, and then re-identifies the data to display the results. One of the judges even referred to this process as HybridAI.

###### Hackathon

The **Hackathon** was another highlight of the event for me. I served as a team captain, and we finished in 2nd place with our team, **'RVTools and Ollama'**. This marks the second year in a row that I've secured 2nd place as a team captain. Our Hackathon team used a GitHub repository to share ideas, discussions, and code. [Click here](https://github.com/dalehassinger/VMware-Explore-Hackathon-2024) to see what we were able to 'hack'.  

Every time I've been involved in the Hackathon, I've met people with amazing ideas. After the Hackathon, we usually stay in touch through social media or direct communication. These friendships are ones that will last a lifetime.

I had the opportunity to meet several of my colleagues in person, which is always a great experience. It was nice to shake hands and personally thank them for all the help they've provided over the past year. One evening, I had a nice dinner with [Cosmin Trif](https://cosmin.gq/), one of the best co-workers I've had in my career. He has been helping me since my days as a VMware customer. My whole VCF Specialists Team is an awesome group!

###### 1:1 meetings with PMs

[VMware Explore](https://www.vmware.com/explore/us) provides [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/) customers with the opportunity to talk directly with product managers, and these face-to-face meetings, whether as a customer or an employee, have always been valuable. This year, I attended one of these meetings to discuss VCF operations. During the discussion, the customer got a sneak peek at the VCF 9 UI. They were impressed and had nothing but positive comments about the product's direction.

###### Venetian Conference Center

The [Venetian Conference Center](https://www.venetianlasvegas.com) is great because it offers the convenience of having everything under one roof. The rooms are comfortable, and the conference food for breakfast and lunch was particularly good this year. There are also plenty of options for a nice dinner. I had dinner at Delmonico one evening, and as always, the food was excellent.

###### Final Thoughts:

I hope I get the opportunity to do it all again next year. VMware Explore is always one of my favorite weeks of the year. I appreciate the chance to give back to the vCommunity, which I believe is incredibly strong. I've never encountered another user group where the members are as passionate about a product as the VMware community is.
