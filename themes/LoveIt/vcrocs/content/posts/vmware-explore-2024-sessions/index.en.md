**Updated: 07/22/2024**

I'm thrilled to announce that I will be presenting four sessions at VMware Explore 2024! Note that two of the VMware {code} sessions have been combined into consecutive presentations, ensuring that all material is covered in these updated sessions. My journey to this moment began at the Mid-Atlantic HVC (Healthcare Virtualization Community) events. I initially attended these events as a VMware customer eager to learn. Eventually, I was invited to present on the automation work I was doing with VMware Products. Though nerve-wracking, my first presentation was a success, and the positive feedback encouraged me to start my blog, sharing knowledge with the vCommunity.  

After countless blog posts and community events, I'm now honored to present a General Session at VMware Explore 2024. For those in the VMware community, this is the pinnacle of recognition and opportunity. I'm excited to bring my passion for VMware products to these sessions, and I invite you to sign up and join me. I'll do my best to share valuable insights and help you enhance your environments. Check out the links to my sessions below and in the [VMware Explore 2024 Content Catalog](https://event.vmware.com/flow/vmware/explore2024lv/content/page/catalog?search=Hassinger). Hope to see you in Vegas!
